    "# Day 1 - Lab 1: AI-Powered Requirements & User Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose a vague problem statement into structured features, user personas, and Agile user stories, culminating in a machine-readable JSON artifact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to the first hands-on lab of the AI-Driven Software Engineering Program! All great software projects begin with a clear understanding of the problem to be solved. In this lab, you will take on the role of a tech lead or product manager and use an LLM as a co-pilot to transform a simple, high-level problem into a set of well-defined, actionable requirements. This process is fundamental to ensuring that the team builds the *right* product.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "Our `utils.py` script is configured to work with multiple AI providers. You can change the `model_name` parameter in the `setup_llm_client()` function to any of the models listed in the `RECOMMENDED_MODELS` dictionary in `utils.py`. For example, to use a Hugging Face model, you could change the line to: `client, model_name, api_provider = setup_llm_client(model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helper Functions Used:**\n",
    "- `setup_llm_client()`: To configure the API client for our chosen LLM.\n",
    "- `get_completion()`: To send a prompt to the LLM and get a response.\n",

      "Of course. As a Senior UX Researcher, I understand that well-defined personas are the foundation of a successful user-centered design process. For an employee onboarding tool, it's crucial to look beyond just the new hire and consider the entire ecosystem of individuals who make the process work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is my step-by-step thinking to arrive at the three most critical personas:\n",
      "1.  **The Primary User:** The most obvious and central user is the new employee. Their experience is the ultimate measure of the tool's success. This is a non-negotiable persona.\n",
      "2.  **The Key Influencer:** Who has the most direct impact on a new hire's role-specific ramp-up and integration? The hiring manager. They are responsible for context, initial tasks, and team integration. A tool that doesn't serve them will create a bottleneck and fail the new hire. This persona is distinct from the new hire because their goals are about enabling productivity, not just learning.\n",
      "3.  **The Process Owner:** Who ensures the onboarding process is consistent, compliant, and scalable across the company? This is typically a role within HR or People Operations. They manage the global, company-wide aspects of onboarding, as opposed to the manager's team-specific focus. Their perspective is essential for ensuring the tool can be managed, maintained, and measured at an organizational level.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three personas—the Learner, the Guide, and the Architect—form a complete and non-overlapping picture of the core needs this tool must address.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1. Complete the `validate_and_save_stories` function below.\n",
    "2. The function should iterate through the list of stories.\n",
    "3. For each story, it must validate that the required keys are present and that the acceptance criteria list is not empty.\n",
    "4. If all stories are valid, it should save the data to `artifacts/day1_user_stories.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A robust script that guarantees the integrity of our requirements artifact. The final output is a validated `day1_user_stories.json` file in the `artifacts` directory, ready to be used as a reliable input for Day 2."

This is the critical first step in an AI-assisted software development lifecycle. The `day1_user_stories.json` file you created will be the direct input for our next lab, where we will generate a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD).\n",
