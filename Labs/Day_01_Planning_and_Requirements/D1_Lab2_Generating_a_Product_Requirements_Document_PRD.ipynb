      "*   **Author:** Senior Product Manager\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Overview & Goals\n",
      "This document outlines the requirements for a new, centralized platform designed to manage the end-to-end new-hire onboarding experience. The platform aims to replace fragmented, manual processes with a streamlined, engaging, and measurable digital workflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary goals are to:\n",
      "*   **Accelerate Time-to-Productivity:** Equip new hires with the information, tools, and relationships they need to be effective quickly.\n",
      "*   **Improve the New Hire Experience:** Provide a clear, guided, and welcoming journey to increase engagement and reduce early-stage attrition.\n",
      "*   **Increase Administrative Efficiency:** Automate repetitive tasks for HR and Hiring Managers, allowing them to focus on high-value, human interactions.\n",
      "*   **Ensure Compliance & Consistency:** Standardize the onboarding process to ensure all new hires complete required paperwork and training in a timely manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Target Personas\n",
      "*   **Alex Chen (New Hire):** Eager to make a good impression and become productive. Needs clarity on what to do, who to know, and how to succeed.\n",
      "*   **Maria Garcia (Hiring Manager):** Responsible for her new hire's success. Needs tools to provide role-specific guidance, track progress, and foster connection without being buried in administrative work.\n",
      "*   **David Miller (HR/Enablement Specialist):** Responsible for the overall onboarding program. Needs a scalable system to manage compliance, track progress across the organization, and identify areas for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Problem Statement\n",
      "Current onboarding processes are often disjointed, relying on a mix of emails, spreadsheets, and manual follow-ups. This creates a confusing and overwhelming experience for new hires, a significant administrative burden for HR, and a lack of visibility for hiring managers. As a result, new hires take longer to become productive, managers struggle to provide consistent guidance, and HR cannot effectively scale or improve the onboarding program.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Success Metrics / KPIs\n",
      "*   **New Hire Time-to-Productivity:**\n",
      "    *   95% of new hires complete all required paperwork before Day 1.\n",

      "    *   Achieve a New Hire eNPS score of +50 for the onboarding experience.\n",
      "*   **Operational Efficiency:**\n",
      "    *   Reduce time spent by HR on manual paperwork tracking by 75%.\n",
      "    *   Increase manager satisfaction with the onboarding process by 30% (measured via internal survey).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Assumptions & Constraints\n",
      "*   **Assumptions:**\n",
      "    *   A source of truth (e.g., HRIS) exists to provide basic new hire data (name, manager, start date, role, department).\n",
      "    *   HR and departmental leaders will provide initial content for templates (e.g., paperwork, plan templates, knowledge base articles).\n",
      "    *   Users have access to a modern web browser on a desktop or mobile device.\n",
      "*   **Constraints:**\n",
      "    *   The initial release will be limited to the features and requirements outlined in this document.\n",

      "*   **Risk:** Scope creep from stakeholders requesting additional features.\n",
      "    *   **Mitigation:** Maintain a prioritized backlog and enforce a change control process. Clearly communicate that out-of-scope items will be considered for future releases.\n",
      "\n",

She worries that critical compliance steps might be missed and that new hires are having a disjointed first impression of the company.\n",
      "*   **David (Hiring Manager):** David is a busy engineering manager who just hired a new software developer. He often forgets to schedule introductory meetings or set up a developer environment until the last minute because his onboarding tasks are buried in his email inbox.

    "### Challenge 3 (Advanced): Programmatic Validation with Pydantic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** We will now create a Pydantic model to represent the structure of our PRD. This allows us to programmatically validate any PRD, ensuring it meets our standards before it's accepted as a formal artifact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Prompt the LLM to generate a Pydantic model that reflects the structure of the `prd_template.md`. The model should have fields for each major section (e.g., `introduction: str`, `user_personas: List[str]`, `user_stories: List[Dict]`).\n",
    "2.  Save this generated model code to a file named `app/validation_models/prd_model.py`.\n",
    "3.  While we won't write the full validation script in this lab, generating the Pydantic model itself is the key advanced step. It creates a reusable, code-based standard for our documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A Python file containing a valid Pydantic model that can be used in the future to validate PRD documents automatically. This represents a shift from manual document review to automated governance."

You also created a Pydantic model to enforce the structure of this document, introducing automated governance into your workflow.
