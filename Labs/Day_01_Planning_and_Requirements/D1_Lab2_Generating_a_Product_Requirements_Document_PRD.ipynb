      "    - **Scenario:** Priya, a remote engineer, is starting next week. She's anxious about her first day, unsure of her schedule, and doesn't know anyone on her team. She has to fill out a dozen PDF forms and has no clear roadmap for how she'll learn the complex codebase, making her feel isolated and unprepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Persona 2: The Hiring Manager (e.g., Maria the Hybrid Manager)**\n",
      "    - **Scenario:** Maria has a new employee starting in two weeks. She spends hours manually creating a list of tasks, emailing IT to set up accounts, and chasing HR for paperwork status. She has no single view to confirm if the new hire's laptop has been shipped or if they have access to key systems, creating a stressful pre-boarding period and risking a poor Day 1 experience.\n",

      "- **Persona 3: The HR/IT Coordinator (Inferred)**\n",
      "    - **Scenario:** With every new hire, the HR team answers the same set of questions about benefits and policies. The IT team fields multiple tickets for standard software access. This repetitive, low-value work consumes significant time that could be spent on more strategic initiatives.\n",

    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Prompt the LLM to generate a Pydantic model that reflects the structure of the `prd_template.md`. The model should have fields for each major section (e.g., `introduction: str`, `user_personas: List[str]`, `user_stories: List[Dict]`).\n",
    "2.  Save this generated model code to a file named `app/validation_models/prd_model.py`.\n",
    "3.  While we won't write the full validation script in this lab, generating the Pydantic model itself is the key advanced step. It creates a reusable, code-based standard for our documentation.\n",

You also created a Pydantic model to enforce the structure of this document, introducing automated governance into your workflow.
