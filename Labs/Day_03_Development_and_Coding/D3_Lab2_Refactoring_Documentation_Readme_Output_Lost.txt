from pydantic import BaseModel
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

from app.db_models import Base, SessionLocal, engine, User
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@app.post("/users/", response_model=UserRead, status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)

    db.add(db_user)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_user)
    return db_user

    return db.query(User).all()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}", response_model=UserRead)
def read_user(user_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_user = db.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()
    if db_user is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
                            detail="User not found")

<instructions>
1. Think step by step to outline all sections that a high-quality README.md should include (e.g., Badges, Table of Contents, Overview, Features, Architecture, Tech Stack, Installation, Quick Start, API Reference with curl examples, Roadmap, Contributing, Security, License, Contact).  
2. After outlining, write the complete README.md in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Ensure:  
   ‚Ä¢ Clear, concise, engaging language for both business stakeholders and developers  
   ‚Ä¢ Consistent heading hierarchy and code-block formatting  
   ‚Ä¢ Concrete installation commands (Python, virtualenv, pip, Docker)  
   ‚Ä¢ Usage examples that show how to hit each FastAPI endpoint with curl and expected JSON responses  
   ‚Ä¢ A summary of the product vision, major features (mapped to user stories/epics), and release roadmap  
   ‚Ä¢ Highlighted security, performance, and accessibility requirements  
   ‚Ä¢ Placeholder badges (build, coverage, license) at the top  
   ‚Ä¢ Standard ‚ÄúContributing‚Äù, ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLicense‚Äù sections (use MIT as default)  
   ‚Ä¢ Future enhancements / out-of-scope items for transparency  
3. Maintain a professional yet friendly tone; avoid marketing fluff.  
4. Perform a quick self-review to ensure completeness, accuracy, and valid Markdown.  
5. Do NOT include the planning notes or any additional commentary in the final output.

## ü§î Why OnboardPro?

Manual, inconsistent onboarding processes create a poor experience for new employees and a significant administrative burden for the company. This often leads to:

-   **Missed Tasks:** Critical setup steps for IT, payroll, or compliance are forgotten.
-   **Compliance Risks:** Inconsistent processes fail to meet legal and regulatory requirements.
-   **Poor New-Hire Experience:** New employees feel disoriented and undervalued from day one.
-   **Wasted Time:** HR and hiring managers lose countless hours on repetitive administrative work.

OnboardPro solves these problems by providing a single source of truth for the entire onboarding journey.

## ‚ú® Features

The initial release (v1.0) focuses on the core workflow engine. Key features include:

-   **Centralized Onboarding Workflows:** Define, manage, and track all onboarding tasks in one place.
-   **Automated Task Assignment:** Automatically assign tasks to HR, hiring managers, IT, and new hires based on role and timeline.
-   **Real-time Progress Tracking:** Visualize the status of every new hire's onboarding journey.
-   **Role-Based Dashboards:** Provide tailored views and to-do lists for each stakeholder.
-   **Secure User Management:** A robust system for managing user accounts and permissions.

*(Based on user stories OB-01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 13)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

OnboardPro is built with a modern, scalable backend stack:

-   **Backend Framework:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for high-performance, asynchronous API development.
-   **Data Validation:** [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for robust data validation and settings management.
-   **Database ORM:** [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for powerful and flexible database interaction.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL (recommended for production).
-   **Containerization:** Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.

The application follows a standard RESTful API architecture with a clear separation between the API layer, business logic, and data persistence.

## üöÄ Getting Started
