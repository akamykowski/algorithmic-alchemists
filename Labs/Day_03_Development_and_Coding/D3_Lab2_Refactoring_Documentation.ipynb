    "2.  Provide the `bad_code` as context.\n",
    "3.  Ask the LLM to refactor the code. Be specific about the improvements you want, such as:\n",
    "    * Breaking the single function into multiple, smaller functions.\n",
    "    * Using built-in Python functions where appropriate (e.g., `sum()`, `max()`).\n",
    "    * Adding clear type hints and return types.\n",
    "\n",

    "Well done! You have used an LLM to perform two of the most valuable code quality tasks: refactoring and documentation. You've seen how AI can help transform messy code into a clean, maintainable structure and how it can generate comprehensive documentation from high-level project artifacts and source code. These skills are a massive productivity multiplier for any development team.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** LLMs excel at understanding and generating structured text, whether that structure is code or documentation. Providing a clear 'before' state (the bad code) and a clear goal (the refactoring principles) allows the AI to perform complex code transformation and documentation tasks efficiently."
