    "Welcome to Day 4! An application without tests is an application that is broken by design. Today, we focus on quality assurance. You will act as a QA Engineer, using an AI co-pilot to build a robust test suite for the API you created yesterday. This is a critical step to ensure our application is reliable and ready for production.\n",

    "Fantastic work! You have built a comprehensive test suite for your API, moving from simple happy path tests to advanced, isolated database testing. You've learned how to use AI to brainstorm edge cases and generate complex fixtures. Having a strong test suite like this gives you the confidence to make changes to your application without fear of breaking existing functionality.\n",

    "> **Key Takeaway:** Using AI to generate tests is a massive force multiplier for quality assurance. It excels at creating boilerplate test code, brainstorming edge cases, and generating complex setup fixtures, allowing developers to build more reliable software faster."
