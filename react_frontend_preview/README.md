# React Frontend Preview

This minimal Vite + Tailwind setup lets you live-edit and preview the `OnboardProDashboard` component.

## Setup

```bash
cd react_frontend_preview
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the shown URL (typically http://localhost:5173) to view the dashboard.

## Editing
- Edit `src/components/OnboardProDashboard.jsx` and save; Vite will hot-reload.
- Tailwind classes are already processed via PostCSS.

## Building (optional)
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- PaletteIcon viewBox typo was fixed.
- Component compiled independently from original artifact; original file left unchanged.
