# Day 4 – Lab 1 Verification Report

This document maps every requirement from `Labs/Day_04_Testing_and_Quality_Assurance/D4_Lab1_Automated_Testing_Quality_Assurance.ipynb` to the artifacts generated by `run_day4_labs.py`, along with live verification evidence.

| Challenge | Requirement Summary | Generated Artifacts | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 – Happy Path Tests | Produce pytest tests covering `POST /users/` success and `GET /users/` returning a list. | `tests/test_main_simple.py` | `pytest tests/test_main_simple.py -v` → 2 passed (2025-10-31) |
| 2 – Edge Case Tests | Add tests for duplicate email (400) and non-existent user (404). | `tests/test_main_simple.py` | Verified code contains edge-case assertions; same pytest run passed. |
| 3 – Isolated DB Fixture | Create fixture overriding `get_db` with in-memory SQLite. | `tests/conftest.py` | Fixture inspected; tables created/dropped per test; dependency override confirmed. |
| 3 – Refactored Tests | Re-write happy-path tests to use the fixture. | `tests/test_main_with_fixture.py` | `pytest tests/test_main_with_fixture.py -v` → 3 passed (2025-10-31). |

**Status:** All Lab 1 requirements are satisfied and tests pass in the current environment.
