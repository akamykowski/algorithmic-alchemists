| **Version** | 1.0 |

## 1. Executive Summary & Vision
OnboardPro is an employee onboarding platform designed to automate and standardize the new hire experience. It replaces manual checklists and fragmented communication with a centralized, trackable workflow for HR, hiring managers, and new employees. Our vision is to create a seamless day-one experience that accelerates new hire productivity, improves engagement, and significantly reduces administrative overhead.

## 2. The Problem
**2.1. Problem Statement:**
The current employee onboarding process is manual, inconsistent, and time-consuming. It relies on spreadsheets, email chains, and ad-hoc follow-ups, leading to missed tasks, compliance risks, and a confusing, impersonal experience for new hires. This administrative burden prevents HR and hiring managers from focusing on high-value activities, while new employees feel disoriented and struggle to become productive.

**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**
*   **Maria (HR Coordinator):** Maria manages onboarding for 10-15 new hires each month across different departments. She spends hours manually creating checklists, sending reminder emails, and tracking down signed paperwork. She worries that critical compliance steps might be missed and that new hires are having a disjointed first impression of the company.
*   **David (Hiring Manager):** David is a busy engineering manager who just hired a new software developer. He often forgets to schedule introductory meetings or set up a developer environment until the last minute because his onboarding tasks are buried in his email inbox. He needs a simple, proactive system to tell him what to do and when.
*   **Priya (New Hire):** Priya is excited to start her new role but feels anxious about her first day. She has received multiple emails with different instructions and attachments. She is unsure what paperwork she needs to complete, who her team members are, or what she should be prepared for, leading to a sense of uncertainty instead of excitement.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics
*How will we measure success?*

| Goal | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Target |

## 8. Appendix & Open Questions
1.  **Dependency:** What is the timeline for securing API access and developer credentials for our primary HRIS (Workday)? The HRIS integration (OB-13) is a critical path dependency for V1.0.
2.  **Open Question:** Which third-party e-signature provider (e.g., DocuSign, HelloSign) will we integrate with for V1.0? A decision is needed based on a review of cost, API capabilities, and security.
3.  **Open Question:** What are the specific, mandatory compliance documents required for Day 1 paperwork across our key operating regions (US, UK, Germany)? We need a finalized list from Legal and HR.
